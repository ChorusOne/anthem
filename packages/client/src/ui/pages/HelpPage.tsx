            Portfolio History Data Integrity Disclaimer
          </H5>
        </Tooltip>
        <p>
          The portfolio history data you see in Anthem is built up by running a
          blockchain node and manually generating a separate copy of the
          blockchain ledger history in an independent database. This process is
          resource intensive, prone to failure, and takes a long time to run.
          Several heuristics and approximations must be applied during this
          process so that the process can support the thousands of address,
          hundreds of thousands of transactions, and millions of blocks which
          exist in a typical blockchain ledger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of these reasons, the resulting data set represents an
          approximation of the account balance history of an address over time
          and not an exact record. You might find small deviations and
          inconsistencies in the dataset. We recommend always reviewing the data
          manually and comparing with the transaction history, which should
          represent an exact record of transactions which occurred for an
          address.

        <p>
          In Celo there is a limit to how much can be staked with a particular
          validator group. As a token holder, you will not receive rewards when
          the capacity of a group has been reached. Our validator list displays
          color coded capacity and in addition (when expanding) the remaining
          capacity of each group. A green capacity button for example means that
          this group has enough room to accept delegations. We use the following
          colors to display remaining capacity: Green = this group has more than
          10% of its total capacity available. Yellow = this group has between
          5-10% of its total capacity available. Orange = this group has between
          1-5% of its total capacity available. Red = this group is at capacity,
          or has less than 1% of its available capacity left.
